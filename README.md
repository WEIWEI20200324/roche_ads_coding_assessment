# Roche ADS Coding Assessment

Coding assessment submission for the Roche Analytical Data Science Programmer position.

---

## Overview

This repository contains my solution to the coding assessment for the Roche Analytical Data Science (ADS) Programmer role.

The solution was primarily implemented in **SAS**, with selected analytical or exploratory components supported in **Python**, reflecting a structured and reproducible programming approach aligned with regulated clinical environments.

The objective of this assessment was to demonstrate:

- Structured analytical thinking
- Strong data integrity practices
- Reproducibility and traceability
- Clear and maintainable programming logic

---

## Solution Approach

The implementation is organized into the following structured stages:

### 1. Data Preparation (SAS)
- Input data loading
- Structural validation checks
- Data consistency verification

### 2. Data Transformation & Derivations (SAS)
- Application of defined derivation logic
- Handling of missing or inconsistent values
- Clear documentation of transformation rules
- Traceable programming structure

### 3. Analytical / Processing Logic
- Core computational logic implemented in SAS
- Modular program structure for readability and maintainability
- Separation of derivation and output generation steps

### 4. Exploratory / Supplementary Analysis (Python, if applicable)
- Optional exploratory summaries or structured data inspection
- Clean and readable analytical scripting
- Focus on clarity rather than unnecessary complexity

### 5. Validation & Output Generation
- Independent validation logic
- Consistency checks
- Structured and reproducible output generation

## Design Principles

The solution was developed following principles commonly applied in regulated data science environments:

- **Reproducibility** – All transformations are explicitly defined.
- **Traceability** – Derivations are structured and logically documented.
- **Data Integrity** – Validation checks are implemented to ensure consistency.
- **Modularity** – Clear separation of processing stages.
- **Maintainability** – Code structure supports review and extension.

---

## Tools & Environment

- **SAS** (Primary implementation)
- **Python** (Supplementary analytical support, if applicable)

The solution prioritizes structured programming discipline while maintaining analytical flexibility.

---

## Assumptions

All assumptions made during implementation are documented within the code comments.

Where assumptions were required, they were applied conservatively and transparently.

---

## Reproducibility

The implementation is deterministic and structured to support review, validation, and potential extension.

All data transformations are explicitly defined, ensuring clarity and auditability.

---

## Closing Note

This submission reflects my approach to analytical data science programming: combining structured regulatory-grade SAS programming with analytical flexibility in Python to deliver robust, traceable, and insight-ready outputs.
